Free Public APIs for Authentication & CRUD TestingIf you are building frontends and need a working backend API without setting up your own database, these are the best free services available:1. DummyJSON (Used in the app above)DummyJSON provides rich mock data including Users, Posts, Products, and built-in JWT Authentication. It's incredibly fast and reliable.Website: https://dummyjson.comAuth (Login): POST https://dummyjson.com/auth/loginCRUD (Read): GET https://dummyjson.com/postsCRUD (Create): POST https://dummyjson.com/posts/add2. ReqresReqres is designed specifically for testing front-end applications against a real API. It simulates real application scenarios (delays, 404s, pagination).Website: https://reqres.in/Auth (Register/Login): POST https://reqres.in/api/login (Returns a token)CRUD (Users): GET, POST, PUT, DELETE at /api/users3. JSONPlaceholderThe most famous mock REST API. It's fantastic for standard CRUD operations, though it does not have built-in Authentication endpoints (it assumes public access).Website: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/Resources: Posts, Comments, Albums, Photos, Todos, Users.CRUD: Fully supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.4. MockAPI.ioIf you want to define your own custom schema (e.g., custom properties for "Cars" or "Employees") without coding a backend, MockAPI allows you to generate a custom API endpoint instantly.Website: https://mockapi.io/Features: Custom endpoints, relationships, pagination, sorting, filtering.Important Note on Mock APIsWhen you perform POST, PUT, or DELETE requests on public mock APIs like JSONPlaceholder or DummyJSON, the server does not actually save your changes to their central database.They will return a successful 200 or 201 response with the mocked object (to prove your code works), but if you refresh the page and do a GET request again, your new data won't be there. In the React app generated for you, this is handled by manually updating the local React state when the API returns a success code.
